# Rewards Program

This is a simple web application that displays a list of customers and their total reward points earned for each month. The application calculates reward points for each customer based on their transactions.

### Technical rules:
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction. (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
